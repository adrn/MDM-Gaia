# MDM-Gaia (Revision 0)

From April 25–April 29, we will provide fast turnaround spectroscopic follow-up of *Gaia* sources using the [MDM](http://mdm.kpno.noao.edu/) 2.4 meter (April 25–26) and 1.3 meter (April 25–29) telescopes. We will have low-resolution spectrographs mounted on each telescope with wavelength coverage from ~4000–7500Å.

**Organizers**:
- Jules Halpern
- Adrian Price-Whelan
- David Schiminovich
- David W. Hogg
- Kathryn V. Johnston

**Observers**:
- David Schiminovich
- Allyson Sheffield
- Joshua Tan
- TBD

Please read the collaboration policy and statement of data rights below, and
check back for full affiliation information.


# Collaboration policy and authorship

To request data through the MDM-*Gaia* effort, you must agree to a few
collaboration policies. First, all organizers (see above) must be invited to
collaborate on any scientific projects that use these data. If any organizer
accepts, they must be invited to coauthor scientific publications or research
products. Second, all observers must be included as coauthors on scientific
publications or research products. Third, you must agree to include a standard
acknowledgement (see below) in all research products that use data obtained
through this collaboration.

## Data rights

Raw data will be made public on the following day. By requesting observations,
you also must agree to release any reduced data products (e.g., extracted,
wavelength-calibrated 1D spectra) and derived quantities (e.g., radial
velocities, chemical abundances) produced for research projects.

## Standard acknowledgement

This is a combination of the standard MDM acknowledgement, and an additional statement acknowledging the organizers of this follow-up effort:

    This work is based on observations obtained at the MDM Observatory, operated
    by Dartmouth College, Columbia University, Ohio State University, Ohio
    University, and the University of Michigan.
    Observations were coordinated by David Schiminovich, Adrian Price-Whelan,
    Jules Halpern, David W. Hogg, and Kathryn V. Johnston.

# Requesting observations

Observations should be requested through a pull request with a very short
Markdown document explaining the target list.
See the [template request
file](https://github.com/adrn/MDM-Gaia/blob/master/requests/TEMPLATE.md) for an
example.

Targets should be submitted as a table readable by
[astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/) (i.e. FITS, ASCII, CSV, etc.).

Note that this is bright time: full moon is on April 29!
