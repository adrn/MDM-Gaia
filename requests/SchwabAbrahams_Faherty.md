Abstract
--------

We request spectroscopy for a dual target list of nearby M dwarfs in the Kepler-Gaia sample that both have confirmed planets (high-priority list) and do not have confirmed planets (low-priority list). This will allow us to further characterize these stars as a contribution to overall M dwarf science and as a study of what intrinsic paramaters impact planetary occurrence.


Calibration frames
------------------

Modular Spectrograph (ModSpec) on the Hiltner 2.4m telescope. Modspec should be configured for 4500 to 7500 Å coverage with ≈1.8 Å sampling and a spectral resolution of ≈3300. We are looking at h-alpha emission lines. Please calibrate and configure accordingly.
