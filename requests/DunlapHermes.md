Abstract
--------

Though the 13-pc white dwarf sample is thought to be complete, we have used Gaia DR2
to discover a new white dwarf only 8.5 pc away. It has a wide binary companion
~14" away (~120 AU projected separation), making it the 5th closest WD binary system to the Sun. 
The white dwarf's color suggests it is a cool (~5000 K) white dwarf.  Neither object has spectroscopic data. We request an
ID spectrum of the white dwarf, which will allow us to determine its spectral type and better constrain the temperature
and cooling age.  This will also allow us to determine the feasibility  of a gravitational redshift measurement, which
would provide an independent mass determination.  We also request a spectrum of the M dwarf
companion, which will help confirm that the association is a binary; the M dwarf has a
poor astrometric fit in DR2, possibly resulting from detected orbital motion. The system has likely escaped
previous detection because it is near the Galactic midplane (l = 4&deg;) and has a space velocity almost identical to the Sun.



Calibration frames and Finder Charts
------------------

We request comparison lamps at both targets. The targets should be aligned to minimize contamination
from nearby stars.  Given the 5 mag difference of the targets, they should probably not be observed simultaneiously.
